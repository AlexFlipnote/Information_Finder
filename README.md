Do you need more help? Visit my server here: **https://discord.gg/AlexFlipnote**

## Requirements
- Discord Canary
- Powercord installed on Discord
- git - https://git-scm.com/download/

## Commands
`.server <banner|features|icon|joined|owner|splash>` = Get more information about yourself

## How to install
1. Locate Powercord plugin folder by opening Discord user settings and following the image bellow.
![Image_Example](https://i.alexflipnote.dev/2mSnX9g.png)
2. Open cmd/terminal inside that directory and do the following command: `git clone https://github.com/AlexFlipnote/pc-Information_Finder`
3. You're done, Powercord will update the plugin for you automatically (which is why git is needed). To take effect, either reload Discord or press the `Fetch Missing Plugins` button inside the same location you found the `Open Plugins Folder` button.

## FAQ
Q: I know about more stuff you can't easily get with normal Discord, make a command!<br>
A: Please do make an issue telling me what would be nice to have as an addition, you can optionally make a pull request as well and add it yourself to the plugin.
